  <p><strong>Monday and Friday</strong> are my <strong>worst days</strong> of the week. I have no frees, and I have to ask my friends to get me food which <em>really sucks</em> because in class I start to zone out from the lack of food in my system. I will costantly ask for a drink of water to help myself focus, but I know thats not enough. Although I have many classes I wouldn't wanna drop any of them, but I need time to myself, and to get work done. Lastly, of couse its on the start and the end of the week.</p>
